# Flight Management Website
In this project of flight management I've learnt how checkin of passengers can be done and inflight services can be added for them. The project involves 2 users-staff member or a admin.As a admin he can add passengers,update passenger details, add ancillary services for flights.
what I've majorly learnt in this is:
- Use of Material UI and Flex layout for designing the required layout.
- Use of Scss/css while giving the css to html pages.
- Maintaining proper folder structure for the better understanding.
- Use of Containers,Class components, React hooks and functional components.
- Use of enzyme and jest for unit testing of components.
- Optional use of service workers for showing offline capability.
- Proper use of redux for maintaining state across application.
- Use of Lazy loading of components.
- Use of proper routing and protecting routes using Higher order components.
- Use of JSON server for serving backend.
- Tech Stack used :
  - Frontend : HTML-5, CSS-3, JavaScript ES-6, Bootstrap-5, React.js, Redux, Material-UI, SCSS.
  - Backend : JSON-Holder.

## Note for the project
- Do `npm start` to run start the react application. Do `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001` in seperate cmd to run json-server for backend.
- If there is any package dependency failure in case of npm start do npm install
- Once the App is running do login by clicking on the Login Button. Without Login You cant proceed further.Make sure your internet is working properly.
- For unit testing run npm test. Unit Testing has been done for one component header.js as per the required criteria.
- Please delete node_modules folder and package.json file from this in case an error occurs while compiling. After that do `npm start` which will automatically detect the packages used in this and install the same along with new package.json.
- Do use Flow Language Support extension incase this file doesn't work. While Flow language support extension is active please disable the TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features extension.
